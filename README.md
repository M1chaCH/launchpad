# launchpad 
Recently, I’ve been thinking about what I’d love to share with someone who’s new to following Jesus. Since I don’t exactly have a crowd of people eager to hear my ramblings, I decided to create a small website to present these thoughts in a clean and engaging way.

It’s also a great opportunity to gain more experience with GSAP and learn about the Astro framework.
So far, I’m really enjoying working with both of them — they’re perfect for a small project like this.
Initially, I was hoping to stick with a fully static, pre-rendered site, but I’ve already run into a case where I needed to use Astro’s server islands. So now, unfortunately, I have to run another Node server in production.
